  - these will correspond to the columns in my GSS
  - belongs_to: guideline
  - belongs_to: company (a company has_many: practices)
  - implementation of a guideline for this company. Do they follow it? t/f/n-a/ambiguous?
  - later on will probably want the values to be a proper enum ... for now int is fine
  - e.g. 'special consent for minors' (T/F)?
  - e.g. 'research data without authorization?'
  - generally all true or false
  - later on ... the 'parent' object will the Document object (which legal doc did the guideline come from?) ... this is important because as I track changes, I'll need to know which guidelines are possibly out of date
- Data entry phase I
  - enter data for ~12 companies
    - enter a set of guidelines
    - then fill in companies / practices for all relevant guidelines
  - maybe ideally a few dozen ... like 50?
  - push to heroku and seed there
