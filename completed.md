  - these will correspond to the columns in my GSS
  - belongs_to: guideline
  - belongs_to: company (a company has_many: practices)
  - implementation of a guideline for this company. Do they follow it? t/f/n-a/ambiguous?
  - later on will probably want the values to be a proper enum ... for now int is fine
  - e.g. 'special consent for minors' (T/F)?
  - e.g. 'research data without authorization?'
  - generally all true or false
  - later on ... the 'parent' object will the Document object (which legal doc did the guideline come from?) ... this is important because as I track changes, I'll need to know which guidelines are possibly out of date
- Data entry phase I
  - enter data for ~12 companies
    - enter a set of guidelines
    - then fill in companies / practices for all relevant guidelines
  - maybe ideally a few dozen ... like 50?
  - push to heroku and seed there
- Consolidate some layout / IA
  - make seed data - X
    -  seed script - X
    - so I can seed DB on heroku - X

  - add some basic docs
    - basic ToS - X
    - define terms (a la RFC) : MUST / SOME / NEVER / ALWAYS / MAY etc - X (linked to ietf description ... should later clean up the words used to make sure they match up)
    - would also be helpful to define a glossary of terms: - X
      - usage data (ip address / cookies / order history)
      - health data (personal metrics on health)
      - aggregate data
  - add footer - X
- Basic styling
  - bootstrap

      - jumbotron style?
    - make company show look good - X
      - use panels / table styles for list of practices
    - fix some styles - X
      - fix highlight style -- I messed up the colors for the highlighting of active state in the nav bar ... think I just need to namespace the styles I added properly
      - same highlight issue in footer
    - make company edit look good - X
      - lots of form helpers / fieldsets - X
    - same for practice show (needs more description around how it relates to its guideline) -X
    - same for guideline show / edit - X
      - provide a guideline 'landing page' to explain how they work
      - guess I found a use for guideline#index after all
  - update the color palette - X
- Thought a bit more on badges, going w the following schema:
  - 'archetype' object
    - is abstract set of practices that one must follow to earn a badge
    - has_many practices
    - has_many badges
  - 'badge' obj
    - stamp of adherance to a set of guidelines
    - belongs_to: company
    - belongs_to: archetype
- Implement new models
  - Archetype
    - index / show / edit / delete
      - show (should have form inline to add practices)
  - Badge
    - list on company show page
    - when practices updated on COMPANY parent object ...
      - there should be a check to see if it implements any badges / if any existing badges need to be removed
    - when practices updated on ARCHETYPE parent object ... need to re-index all badges!!!?!?
      - that seems like it will take quite a long time
      - cant just negate existing badges that use archetype ... because new companies may qualify for the badge
      - maybe negate the ones that have it ... then update the ones that are newly eligible next time they're saved? Or kickoff long term job to cycle through those?
      - wont be an issue immediately ... but eventually if there are 10k company rows ... this is will be costly
      - then again ... probably wont be adding / changing badges very often
    - shouldn't have to add anything special to seeds as long as a company implements an arch, they should get the badge upon guideline creation
- Badge
  - Build basic iconography to represent important aspects of agreements
- Update seeds
  - Add a few archetypes
  - hmmm now im now populating companies correctly ...
    - i think this may have happened whn i introd polymorphism
  - update seeds.rb to populate archetypes
  - Make sure some companies implement none/one/some
- Get icon paths working on heroku
  - this is prob going to be annoying
X  - also adjust the icon styles -- would like to be white on dark blue
X - OMG this was so silly -- this helped me out (kinda) : https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/issues/86
X - I spent sooo much time on this ... compared to everything else. Like ... 3+ hours
