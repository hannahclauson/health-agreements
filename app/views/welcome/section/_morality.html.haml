    %h1 Personal Moral Judgment
  %p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How you decide to share your health data is a hugely personal one.

  %p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are data-conservative (link?). Others are data-progressive (link?). We don't grade companies based on their symbols or data practices.

  %p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we believe the best way for us to make progress w how health data is used broadly is to inform. These companies are trying to do a lot of good with your data, but sharing your data isn't for everyone.

  %p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Read here to find out if you're a data conservative or progressive)
