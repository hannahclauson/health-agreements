# Inform. Comprehend. Volunteer

Modern consent law (ref here) frames consent into three steps:

## Inform

A user should be presented with all of the information required to describe the agreement in full.

## Comprehend

A user should be able to comprehend all of the terms in the agreement.

## Volunteer

A user must opt in to show that they have agreed to the terms.

## Today

But thats a far cry from what we're used to every single time we use a digital service.

Today when using any digital service you are presented with a wall of text style Terms of Service.

In theory the company has provided you with the facts to 'inform' you, but thats pretty disingenuous. Yes, they've technically met that bar, but definitely not in a way to support you in 'comprehending' the agreement.

So you do what we all do. You click 'I agree', the 'volunteer' step.

Today what we have miserably fails the 'comprehend' step, and grudgingly (if we're being generous) fulfills the inform step.

We can do better.

Symbol of Health aims to distill the information so that you can start understanding what you are agreeing to.

Our broader goal is to get people better informed about what they're agreeing to and the expectations around how their health data is used.
