## Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, SAGE BIONETWORKS OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ACCESS OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT OR DATA (INCLUDING USER MATERIALS) MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SAGE BIONETWORKS OR ANY SUPPLIER OR LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES).

to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY OF 'Symbol of Health' AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS under these terms or otherwise in connection with the service and any content OR DATA (INCLUDING USER MATERIALS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS $50. THIS SECTION 16 DOES NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF 'Symbol of Health' FOR any liability that cannot be limited or excluded by law, including, in certain jurisdictions, liability for FRAUD or FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM negligence OF 'Symbol of Health'.

APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, YOU AGREE THAT BECAUSE SUCH WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND SAGE BIONETWORKS, AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND SAGE BIONETWORKS, SAGE BIONETWORKS’ AND ITS LICENSORS’ AND SUPPLIERS’ LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
