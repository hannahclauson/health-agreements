# About Us

## Mission Statement

Symbol of Health aims to inform the public about how their health data is being used and the consequences of their choices.

## The Coming Storm

There are companies striving to help people at quite a large scale. We hope to truly see some amazing advances in health technology over the coming years.

[Here](blank) is a great example of some amazing things that are already happening.

But!

There are going to be inevitable misteps. There will be data breaches. There will be companies using data in surprising ways until someone wakes up and it blows up. There will be PR nightmares. There will be large swathes of users who are upset (and rightly so). In fact, thats already happening (example w same comp).

And thats where we come in.

We are as excited as anyone else about the hopes for the future of health technology. But we see the coming storm. And our best defense? The best way we can all make progress and make peace with these inevitable stumbles is to be informed.

Symbol of Health will keep you informed.

Today, we have:

- Many companies terms of service indexed and distilled
- Many articles listed by company so you can understand the good that is being done w your data
- Companies indexed by 'impact factor' so that you can see who's doing the most good w your data

And this is just the beginning.

## We are NOT your moral compass

Its also important to state what we are not. We are not your moral compass.

Sharing your data is not for everyone. We want to inform people so they can make an actice choice. The likelihood of a data breach is usually small, but it can have catastrophic consequences for you personally (financially, professionally, ethically). And it can effect your family members too.

For some people, the risks won't be worth it. Thats fine. If everyone was making well informed active choices about how their PHI was used, then when data breaches happened, the impact would be minimized. The company w the breach on their hands still has a lot of due diligence to make up the trust and be clear about how it happened and why it won't happen again. But! Those people who have actively opted in should understand that, and be amenable to rebuilding that trust.

NOTE - (would be good to provide links to each of those types of consequences)

## Active Choices
