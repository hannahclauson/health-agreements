# Glossary

## Keywords

You may have noticed that some words throughout the site are in CAPs. We're not yelling at you, but instead trying to be precise with our language. This language SHOULD follow the guidelines that the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) adopts when using this language to write their RFCs. For more information, [see this description](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Types of Data

### Service / Usage Data

Data related to your usage of the service. This may include things such as:

- IP address logs
- order history
- cookies

Usually tracking of this information is par for the course. It is rare to find a company that does not track these things.

### User Created Content / Data

Most often this pertains to any forums / social activity through a service. Different companies may retain copyright of this information.

In these cases, while it may seem they're only tracking content, this is often a proxy for a broad definition of data. 

E.g. if you're using a wearable and posting your stats every day ... its easy to see how the content also includes some data

E.g. Another example would be the frequency of your posts about you going to the gym. The presence of these posts is data about your fitness habits.

### Personal Health Information (PHI)

Medical metrics that apply to your person. Could be anything from test results to recommendations from the system.

### Aggregate Data

This is a vague concept and important to understand. Aggregate data is defined as data that is anonymized and combined before being reported.

E.g. A company may not report your weight, but may report average weights to a researcher.

Even this does not establish a clear boundary. There have been cases where even aggregate data has been used to identify an individual and associate them w particular health data.

E.g. If a company reports average weights per region, but you happen to be the only user for that region, it is apparent that the aggregate data is the same as your personal data.

## Types of Research

### Private Research

Research done by and for private entities. This research MAY never be published or shared.

### Peer Reviewed Research

Research reviewed by peers and published in a journal. 

### Public Research

We define Public Research as both 'Peer Reviewed Research' AND the condition that the publication is made available for free to the general public.

## Misc

### Healthcare Provider

A 3rd party professional entity that provides a health service to you.

### HIPAA

[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/formsandpubs/laws/hipaa/Pages/1.00WhatisHIPAA.aspx) - provides certain security guidelines for your Personal Health Information (PHI). These guidelines are looked at as a reasonable effort for your PHI protection. There are equivalent laws for non-US states (todo - list here).

Note - A company can be 'HIPAA Compliant' meaning they have made the effort to adhere to HIPAAs guidelines. There is no such thing as 'HIPAA certified' - there is no certification that says a 3rd party has reviewed an entity's adherence to HIPAA's guidelines.


### Safe Harbor

[A set of privacy guidelines established by the US and EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles)
