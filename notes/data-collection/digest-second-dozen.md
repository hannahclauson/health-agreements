New Oddballs (things to consider):

- special clause for OSS license terms
- specific clause prohibits scraping (pillpack)
- special clause for CA - can request how info is shared/marketed - once/year
- sublicence to accept on behalf students/parents

New rules / patterns:

- legal jurisdiction
- 'mistakes will happen' clause (internet is not secure / etc)
- 'not medical advice'
- use of site == consent
  - other consent triggers?
- may be interesting to note what personal info is required for using the service
  - ex. email/name/pwd/addr/payment/cookie/ip/etc?
- respond to 'do not track'
- if you email - consent to releasing your PHI (woah)
  - maybe more generally confidentiality in communications (email/etc)
