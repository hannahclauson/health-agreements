Hannah's list includes lots of B2B and some that do both B2B/B2C so want to scan a bunch of those. Am looking at:

benchling
metabiota
onecodex
pillpack
recombine
secondgenome
seres health
labster
inspire sleep
nant health
prolacta
regenex bio

In this round. Rough notes here / below.

----

(benchling)
(PP)

- Lots of terms around website usage / data tracking there
- publish aggregate data / data used for services type of language
- may not be a 'badge'/guideline ... but good thing for consumer education
- maybe @blogpost
- usually track IPs to some extent ... again pretty standard ... educate consumers
- maaaybe highlight companies that wont give out any individ info (even if subpoena'd)
- and list companies w 'honeypots' (not the right word ... but silent way of disclosing they're being served by secret court)

Not much else to their PP than website visitor usage.

(ToS)

- differentiate btw Benchling data (html/data/website/media/code/scripts/processes) ... wow super vague list ... and 'Customer Data' - presumably the actual genomes being analyzed
- include service / usage data
- 3 categories: Benchling Data / Customer Data / Confidential Data
- 'developments' - derivative works (def legal term)
- IP rights

- woah - customer responsible for 'reasonably' cooperating in marketing / cost analysis / etc efforts?

- License to:
  - access B sys
  - use B Data just to evaluate effectiveness of B sys (whaaat?)
  - mostly access stuff
- L => B can
  - use C data for improving services 
- L => C cannot resell / publich B data ... how is this applicable at all w PRPs? (peer reviewed publications)

- standard as-is warranty/disclaimer
- limit liability disclaimer

Ownership

- customer -> only C data
- B -> only B data, IP for all B data / B sys
- IP of C data only w C
- any 'developments' forfeit IP to B

confidentiality
- clearly here for a purpose
- maybe patents?

Force Majeure !

Relationship (b2b)
- contractors 
- not agent/partner / etc

--

ok interesting omissions from ToC:

- no mention of data integrity / security / hosting practices
- actually ... no (double check?) suggestion of customer resp for best practices / data security / etc
- HIPAA? not mentioned
- aggregate data
- customer only accesses their data
- some ambiguity about what analyses can be used / shared
- 

no easy list of publications using benchling via google
- though they def have publication tools
(summary / references in their tool / figures / etc)

---

(metabiota)

special terms for 'US govt end users'
