Theres a lot of nuance in the guidelines

Its very easy to not capture the meaning of their terms. I'll try to list discrepancies / further iteration ideas here (w eaxmples).


# Consent?

consent is a big question and may need a lot more refinement

- peer reviewed publications - some do it auto once you use service, some opt in and out, some use aggregate data without opt in but personal with opt in (ubiome)
- research opt out - some companies allow opt out only for PERSONAL health data, not aggregate


# Reporting

- companies that report should be rated higher
- should all practices be reported for all companies? even if unknown?
 
# Research

- want to refine 'public / peer reviewed' into separate guidelines
- published in a way that anyone can download should be separated and touted
- may also include a badge for high impact studies?
