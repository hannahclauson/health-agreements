- Create 'badges' model to show succinct information about a company's use of health data
  - e.g. 'Public Research' icon - they provide info for research

  - schema:
    - badge belongs_to: company
    - company has_many: badges
    - badge has_many: practices
    - practice belongs_to: badge (now this is a three way belongs_to ?)
  - seems like I'm dancing around some sort of measure of equality of a set of practices
  - maybe theres a better way to do this

  - alerts  / UI changes to denot
  - cost est for this amt of data / traffic
- Data Entry Phase III
  - make sure all document links are specified
  - should have about a hundred companies
  - let run for a week or so to see how data performs
  - include test company (maybe this site itself) to validate change detection
- Launch Site

- Data Entry Phase IV
  - big data push - hundreds of sites as goal
  - ideally 1k companies
- Request Addition / Modification

Nice to Haves:

- Add some more details
  - add t/f or n/a or ambiguous to acceptable values for a 'rule'
- if they support public peer-reviewed research, links to relevant studies
- crawl/save/hash all agreements so we can track changes + alert when info may be out of date
- Add user based submissions
  - is there a way to use linkedin to verify you're a lawyer?
  - or a public registry for identity / prove you passed the bar?
  - would be nice to be able to have lawyers volunteer their time in some capacity
