Nice to Haves:

- Performance upgrade
  - access helpers
    - all my access_to_action() helper calls add up .. esp on index pages
    - can really cache the result of these calls / add to the user model so that they aren't made a ton
    - but bench first I guess
  - badge assignment
    - that ones pretty gnarly
    - start w benchmarks
    - then make a bunch of dummy companies (~1k / 10k) and see how it performs
    - optimize what I can
    - open to refactoring schema
    - or doing batch / background job
- Update UX
  - on company show page, provide JS filters for each column (prob at least implements col)
  - maybe also provide option to see all guidelines (and whether they follow or now)
  - company comparison view -- compare company's implementations of (all? -- at least union) or practices
- Comparison Functionality
  - compare companies (2+?)
- Add script to dump current DB to a seeds.rb file
  - a la : http://www.xyzpub.com/en/ruby-on-rails/3.2/seed_rb.html
  - will be handy as I go through iterations of populating the DB and revising the content
- if they support public peer-reviewed research, links to relevant studies
  - articles are a new model
  - would like to save name / journal / impact factor
  - provide weighted impact score for company
UX upgrade
  - update index pages
    - badges - sort by date
    - updated agreements (new docs)
  - update credits page w example of icons -- need to abstract badge helper some more
  - make search by badge use badge icons?
- Add user based submissions
  - is there a way to use linkedin to verify you're a lawyer?
  - or a public registry for identity / prove you passed the bar?
  - would be nice to be able to have lawyers volunteer their time in some capacity
- Add developer API for access to the information programmatically
- Other info / models
  - Studies (esp open enrollment / results / etc)
    - e.g. amiigo's project pulse / other med studies / FDA studies?
  - private research results? blog posts?
- Testing update
    - View button testing
      - use view tests to validate action buttons
      - are present only as appropriate (see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html section 4.8)
