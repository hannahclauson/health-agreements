Nice to Haves:

- Add script to dump current DB to a seeds.rb file
  - a la : http://www.xyzpub.com/en/ruby-on-rails/3.2/seed_rb.html
  - will be handy as I go through iterations of populating the DB and revising the content
- Add some more details
  - add t/f or n/a or ambiguous to acceptable values for a 'rule'
- if they support public peer-reviewed research, links to relevant studies
- crawl/save/hash all agreements so we can track changes + alert when info may be out of date
- Add user based submissions
  - is there a way to use linkedin to verify you're a lawyer?
  - or a public registry for identity / prove you passed the bar?
  - would be nice to be able to have lawyers volunteer their time in some capacity
- Add developer API for access to the information programmatically
