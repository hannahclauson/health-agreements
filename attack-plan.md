  - I want abstract 'guidelines' that a company implements some way via a 'practice'
  
- Create 'guidelines' model to describe how an aspect of a company's relationship w its users
  - these will correspond to the columns in my GSS
  - e.g. 'special consent for minors' (T/F)?
  - e.g. 'research data without authorization?'
  - generally all true or false
  - Company <-> metric is one to many
  - later on ... the 'parent' object will the Document object (which legal doc did the guideline come from?) ... this is important because as I track changes, I'll need to know which guidelines are possibly out of date
- Consolidate some layout / IA
  - make seed data
  - update homepage
  - get header working / layout/application views inheriting properly
- Update company schema / controllers:
  - hook in activeadmin for company creation for now
    - will this suffice for relationships too?

    - website
    - privacy link
    - Terms of Service link
  - update seeds
- Data entry phase I
  - enter data for ~12 companies
  - maybe ideally a few dozen ... like 50?
- Create 'badges' model to show succinct information about a company's use of health data
  - e.g. 'Public Research' icon - they provide info for research
  - e.g. 'Privacy Warden' icon - they only share info w explicit consent
  - badge -> metric is one to many
  - Build basic iconography to represent important aspects of agreements
- Add basic auth wall
- Basic styling
  - bootstrap / kickstrap?
  - something to make it look ok, nothing fancy
  - create iconography / find iconography for badges
- Create search methods
  - search by badge
  - search by rule values
- Create users
  - use devise (seems standard)
  - editor-level
  - can add information / modify results
  - need to make sure edit history is logged
- Data Entry Phase II
  - another few dozen companies
  - refine existing data / review
  - refine badges (definitions / new ones / etc)

  - upgrade middleware (puma / unicorn)
  - have mechanism for high fidelity DB backup / routinely do this
  - add ToS - IANAL / etc - for information purposes ONLY / starting point not legal advice
- Setup polling data
  - New model: Document
    - URL
    - poll date
    - hash
  - Async jobs to get these periodically
  - New view (for companies) to see revision history per document type
    - comparison view to compare two versions (visualize diff)
  - alerts  / UI changes to denot
  - cost est for this amt of data / traffic
- Data Entry Phase III
  - make sure all document links are specified
  - big data push - hundreds of sites as goal
  - ideally 1k companies
- Request Addition / Modification
  - form to request a company added to list
  - form to request a modification
  - form for new badge type?

Nice to Haves:

- Add some more details
  - add t/f or n/a or ambiguous to acceptable values for a 'rule'
- if they support public peer-reviewed research, links to relevant studies
- crawl/save/hash all agreements so we can track changes + alert when info may be out of date
- Add user based submissions
  - is there a way to use linkedin to verify you're a lawyer?
  - or a public registry for identity / prove you passed the bar?
  - would be nice to be able to have lawyers volunteer their time in some capacity
