  - has_one: guideline
  - belongs_to: company (a company has_many: practices)
  - implementation of a guideline for this company. Do they follow it? t/f/n-a/ambiguous?
  - later on will probably want the values to be a proper enum ... for now int is fine
  - e.g. 'special consent for minors' (T/F)?
  - e.g. 'research data without authorization?'
  - generally all true or false
  - later on ... the 'parent' object will the Document object (which legal doc did the guideline come from?) ... this is important because as I track changes, I'll need to know which guidelines are possibly out of date

Nice to Haves:

- Add some more details
  - add t/f or n/a or ambiguous to acceptable values for a 'rule'
- if they support public peer-reviewed research, links to relevant studies
- crawl/save/hash all agreements so we can track changes + alert when info may be out of date
- Add user based submissions
  - is there a way to use linkedin to verify you're a lawyer?
  - or a public registry for identity / prove you passed the bar?
  - would be nice to be able to have lawyers volunteer their time in some capacity
