- Create company scaffold (mvc)
  - create company view - X
  - create list view - X
  - make 'new' view - X
  - Deploy to heroku -X
  - add validators - X
  - add udpate method - X
  - refactor views into partials - X  
  - create delete method - X
- Think about new model a bit before generating
  - I want abstract 'guidelines' that a company implements some way via a 'practice' -X
- Create 'guideline' model
  - abstract rule that can be followed
  - name
  - desc
  - truth_value - what it means to be followed
  - false_value - what it means to not be followed
  - na_value - what it means to be n/a
  - no parent object
- Create 'practice' model
  - these will correspond to the columns in my GSS
  - has_one: guideline
  - belongs_to: company (a company has_many: practices)
  - implementation of a guideline for this company. Do they follow it? t/f/n-a/ambiguous?
  - later on will probably want the values to be a proper enum ... for now int is fine
  - e.g. 'special consent for minors' (T/F)?
  - e.g. 'research data without authorization?'
  - generally all true or false
  - later on ... the 'parent' object will the Document object (which legal doc did the guideline come from?) ... this is important because as I track changes, I'll need to know which guidelines are possibly out of date
- Consolidate some layout / IA
  - make seed data
  - update homepage
  - get header working / layout/application views inheriting properly
- Update company schema / controllers:
  - hook in activeadmin for company creation for now
    - will this suffice for relationships too?
- Data entry phase I
  - enter data for ~12 companies
  - maybe ideally a few dozen ... like 50?
- Create 'badges' model to show succinct information about a company's use of health data
  - e.g. 'Public Research' icon - they provide info for research
  - e.g. 'Privacy Warden' icon - they only share info w explicit consent
  - badge -> metric is one to many
  - Build basic iconography to represent important aspects of agreements
- Add basic auth wall
- Basic styling
  - bootstrap / kickstrap?
  - something to make it look ok, nothing fancy
  - create iconography / find iconography for badges
- Create search methods
  - search by badge
  - search by rule values
- Create users
  - use devise (seems standard)
  - editor-level
  - can add information / modify results
  - need to make sure edit history is logged
- Data Entry Phase II
  - another few dozen companies
  - refine existing data / review
  - refine badges (definitions / new ones / etc)
- Make production ready
  - upgrade middleware (puma / unicorn)
  - have mechanism for high fidelity DB backup / routinely do this
  - add ToS - IANAL / etc - for information purposes ONLY / starting point not legal advice
  - estimate monthly costs
  - add to my contracting firm?
- Setup polling data
  - New model: Document
    - URL
    - poll date
    - hash
  - Company has_many documents
  - Async jobs to get these periodically
  - New view (for companies) to see revision history per document type
    - comparison view to compare two versions (visualize diff)
  - alerts  / UI changes to denot
  - cost est for this amt of data / traffic
- Data Entry Phase III
  - make sure all document links are specified
  - should have about a hundred companies
  - let run for a week or so to see how data performs
  - include test company (maybe this site itself) to validate change detection
- Launch Site
  - remove basic auth wall
  - publish / make OSS?
- Data Entry Phase IV
  - big data push - hundreds of sites as goal
  - ideally 1k companies
- Request Addition / Modification
  - form to request a company added to list
  - form to request a modification
  - form for new badge type?

Nice to Haves:

- Add some more details
  - add t/f or n/a or ambiguous to acceptable values for a 'rule'
- if they support public peer-reviewed research, links to relevant studies
- crawl/save/hash all agreements so we can track changes + alert when info may be out of date
- Add user based submissions
  - is there a way to use linkedin to verify you're a lawyer?
  - or a public registry for identity / prove you passed the bar?
  - would be nice to be able to have lawyers volunteer their time in some capacity
